    Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point. The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0. The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.

	For example, if the first random number is -3, and the second random number is 2, your array will be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2

    

$start = get-random -maximum 0 -minimum -10
$stop = get-random -maximum 20 -minimum 1
$arry = ($start..$stop)




	
Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse

	Using the above example, your reversed array will be 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3 

$arry = ($stop..$start)
