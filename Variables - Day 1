    Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.

    Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.

    Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.

    Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.

    Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.

    Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.

    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" + "var2" = "sum"

    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" - "var2" = "sub"

    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" * "var2" = "prod"

    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" / "var2" = "quo"
