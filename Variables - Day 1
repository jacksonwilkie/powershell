    Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
$var1 = get-random -maximum 50 -minimum 25


    Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.
$var2 = get-random -maximum 10 -minimum 1


    Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.
$sum = $var1 + $var2


    Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.
$sub = $var1 - $var2



    Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.
$prod = $var1 * $var2

    Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.
$quo = $var1 / $var2
    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" + "var2" = "sum"
30 + 5 = 35
    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" - "var2" = "sub"
30 - 5 = 25
    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" * "var2" = "prod"
30 * 5 = 150
    Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" / "var2" = "quo"
30 / 5 = 6
