Create two empty hash tables with the following names:

    employee1
$employee1 = @{}
    employee2
$employee2 = @{}

Using the following table of key-value pairs, apply each key-value to the empty hash tables.
Table 1. keys and values First 	Last 	ID 	Job

Mary
	

Hopper
	

001
	

Software Developer

$employee1=[ordered] @{First = "Mary"; Last = "Hopper"; ID = "001"; Job = "Software Developer"}


John
	

Williams
	

002
	

Web Developer

$employee2=[ordered] @{First = "John"; Last = "Williams"; ID = "002"; Job = "Web Developer"}


The keys on the first row of the table while the values are on the first column of the table

Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employeeâ€™s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).

Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"
 $employee1["Job"] = "Software Lead"

Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.
Table 2. employee3 First 	Last 	ID 	Job

Alex
	

Moran
	

003
	

Software Developer


Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:
Table 3. Status Mary 	John 	Alex


 $employee1["Status"]= "Management"
Management
	

Intermediate
	

Entry Level
